# Introduction

This repository is created on "https://github.com/MentarisHub121/TokenPresaleApp.git". The motivation of this repository is to present my skill on relavent field specially on contract development using solidity. The main goal is to present my skills that I am competent on guiding teams on developing smart contracts using solidity to make audit ready. In addition I presented a very short introduction on our relavent project.

First I like to intrduce our current crypto wallets. I just presented terminologies that were key point for our work (like soft, hot etc). The deatisl is not in my intension as these are welknown.

I had run the frontend from the repository and as of your suggession, I tried to provide some feedbacks.

To make a contract audit ready, it is important to have code documentations and using some standard libraries. I have selected the file (https://github.com/MentarisHub121/TokenPresaleApp/blob/main/contracts/token_presale.sol) and created some tests on this as sample.

Here I tried to share my skills on auditing contracts. As a senior team member I think I need this skill for internal audit and how external auditors thinks. The audit is very simple as example. Original audit need some thorough steps (including POC and more detailed Guidelines with refferences)
